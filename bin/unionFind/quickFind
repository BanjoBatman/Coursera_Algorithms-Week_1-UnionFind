union find is a way to see if two things are related.
For instance, is there a path between two points in a maze type graph.


so a base class for UnionFind would look something like this:

UF(int n) // initialize a union structure with N objects (0 to n-1)
void union(int p, int q) // create a connection between p and q
boolean connected (int p, int q) // return true if p and q are in the same "component" IE, are they connected.
int find(int p) // return the component identifier for P
int count() // return the number of components
